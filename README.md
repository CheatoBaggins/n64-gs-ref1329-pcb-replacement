# N64-Gameshark-Pro-REF1329
An optimized PCB for the N64 Gameshark Pro as well as the full schematics. This revision has full parallel port functionality. The Gameshark Pro v3.3.bin file should be programmed with the low bytes to the bottom SST and the high bytes to the top SST. The schematics include the PIC12C508A and associated pull-up resistors that were never shipped with commercial units, though the footprints and traces exist on all commercial units. Details on the functionality of the PIC12C508A can be found [here.](https://github.com/parasyte/picard)
